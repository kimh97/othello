After making a simple heuristic (one that uses board values), I combined it with another heuristic (one that sees how many pieces are left after move is made). I weighed them equivalently and then used the combined value to see which move is the best.

I also thought of trying recursion to forsee in depth but I realized I would have to return two values (which is impossible) so I was not able to do it.
